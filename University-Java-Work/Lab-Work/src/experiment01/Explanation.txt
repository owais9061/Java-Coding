It's a simple JAVA program in which we just simply use a 
SYSTEM.OUT.PRINTLN statement to print a certain thing
and then use CMD (COmmand Prompt) to run it without the IDE (Ecclipse)

by :
1- open CMD inthe folder where the file is located
2- type javac [name of the file such as code.java, one,java]

REMEBR: to put .java in the name

THAT's it, the CMD will show the print statement you write in the code.
